# 2022_miniproj
Arduino based project for college submission.


The basic project idea is to integrate automated order collection and order distribution system found commonly in Japanese restaurants and show it using Arduino systems.
The basic setup uses a touch based order selection pad .The order obtained from the tables are transmitted via a transmitter system to the kitchen area. The received data is used to prepare the food order and deliver it via an automated system(aestheticaly pleasing). The proposed delivery vehicle is to use a line follower robot.
